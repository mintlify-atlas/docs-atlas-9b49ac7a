## Overview

TUIOS provides **9 independent workspaces** for organizing your terminal windows. Think of workspaces as virtual desktops - each one can contain multiple windows with their own layout, and you can quickly switch between them.

Workspaces are perfect for:
- Separating different projects or contexts
- Organizing development, monitoring, and operations tasks
- Creating dedicated environments for specific workflows
- Reducing clutter by grouping related windows together

## Switching Workspaces

### Quick Switch

The fastest way to switch workspaces is using keyboard shortcuts:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Linux
# Switch to workspace 1-9
Alt+1  # Workspace 1
Alt+2  # Workspace 2
Alt+3  # Workspace 3
# ... and so on through Alt+9
```

```bash macOS
# Switch to workspace 1-9
Option+1  # Workspace 1 (⌥+1)
Option+2  # Workspace 2 (⌥+2)
Option+3  # Workspace 3 (⌥+3)
# ... and so on through Option+9
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
On macOS, the `Option` key (⌥) is used instead of `Alt`. The default configuration automatically handles this platform difference.
</Note>

### Prefix-Based Switching

Alternatively, use the prefix key followed by workspace menu:

```bash
# Using prefix key (Ctrl+B by default)
Ctrl+B w 1    # Switch to workspace 1
Ctrl+B w 2    # Switch to workspace 2
# ... etc
```

### CLI Remote Control

Switch workspaces from the command line using remote control:

```bash
# Switch to workspace 2 in running session
tuios run-command SwitchWorkspace 2

# Switch in a specific session
tuios run-command -s mysession SwitchWorkspace 3
```

## Moving Windows Between Workspaces

### Move and Follow

The most common operation is to move the focused window to another workspace and switch to that workspace:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Linux
# Move window to workspace and follow
Alt+Shift+1  # Move to workspace 1 and follow
Alt+Shift+2  # Move to workspace 2 and follow
# ... and so on
```

```bash macOS
# Move window to workspace and follow
Option+Shift+1  # Move to workspace 1 and follow
Option+Shift+2  # Move to workspace 2 and follow
# ... and so on
```
</CodeGroup>

### Move Without Following

To move a window to another workspace without switching to it, use the prefix menu:

```bash
Ctrl+B w Shift+1  # Move to workspace 1 (stay on current workspace)
Ctrl+B w Shift+2  # Move to workspace 2 (stay on current workspace)
```

### CLI Window Movement

```bash
# Move focused window to workspace 3
tuios run-command MoveToWorkspace 3
```

## Workspace State

### Persistence

Each workspace independently maintains:
- **Window positions and sizes** - Layouts are preserved per workspace
- **Tiling configuration** - Each workspace can have tiling on or off
- **Custom layouts** - Manual split configurations persist
- **Focus history** - When you return to a workspace, the previously focused window is restored
- **Master ratio settings** - Resize adjustments are workspace-specific

### Session Persistence

When using daemon mode (`tuios new` / `tuios attach`), all workspace state persists across detach/reattach:

```bash
# Create a persistent session
tuios new myproject

# Set up workspaces 1-3 with different windows
# ... work for a while ...

# Detach (Ctrl+B d)
# ... later ...

# Reattach - all workspaces and windows are restored
tuios attach myproject
```

## Workspace Indicators

The dockbar (status bar) shows workspace information:

- **Current workspace number** - Displayed prominently (e.g., `WS 1`)
- **Window count per workspace** - Visual indicators show which workspaces have windows
- **Active workspace highlight** - The current workspace is highlighted

<Info>
Empty workspaces are dimmed in the indicator. This makes it easy to see at a glance which workspaces are in use.
</Info>

## Practical Workflows

### Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Workspace 1: Code editor
Alt+1
n  # New window
i  # Enter terminal mode
vim src/main.go

# Workspace 2: Build and test
Alt+2
n
i
go test -v ./...

# Workspace 3: Git operations
Alt+3
n
i
tig  # Or your preferred git UI

# Workspace 4: Server logs
Alt+4
n
i
tail -f /var/log/app.log
```

### Quick Context Switch

```bash
# Jump between contexts instantly
Alt+1  # Back to code
Alt+4  # Check logs
Alt+2  # Run tests
Alt+1  # Return to code
```

### Project Organization

Organize multiple projects across workspaces:

- **Workspace 1-3**: Project A (frontend, backend, database)
- **Workspace 4-6**: Project B (microservices)
- **Workspace 7**: System monitoring
- **Workspace 8**: Email/chat clients
- **Workspace 9**: Scratch/temporary work

### Multi-Client Setup

When using SSH or web terminals, each client can be on different workspaces in the same session:

```bash
# Terminal 1: ssh to server
ssh user@server
tuios attach shared
Alt+1  # Work on workspace 1

# Terminal 2: On same server
ssh user@server  
tuios attach shared
Alt+2  # Work on workspace 2

# Both clients share the same session but can view different workspaces
```

## Implementation Details

### Source Code Reference

Workspace functionality is implemented in `internal/app/workspace.go` with key functions:

- `SwitchToWorkspace(workspace int)` - Handles workspace switching with animation cleanup and layout restoration
- `MoveWindowToWorkspace(windowIndex, workspace int)` - Moves window without following
- `MoveWindowToWorkspaceAndFollow(windowIndex, workspace int)` - Moves and switches
- `GetWorkspaceWindowCount(workspace int)` - Counts windows in a workspace

### Memory Efficiency

Workspaces are lightweight:
- No duplication of window data
- Windows store their workspace number
- State maps are used for per-workspace configuration
- Only visible windows (current workspace) are rendered

### Multi-Client Coordination

In daemon mode with multiple clients:
- Each client can be on a different workspace
- PTY subscriptions are workspace-aware (only visible windows stream output)
- Workspace switches are local to each client
- State synchronization keeps all clients consistent

## Configuration

Workspace keybindings are configurable in `~/.config/tuios/config.toml`:

```toml
# Default workspace switch bindings (Linux)
[keybindings.workspace]
"alt+1" = "SwitchToWorkspace1"
"alt+2" = "SwitchToWorkspace2"
# ... etc

# Default workspace move bindings (Linux)  
"alt+shift+1" = "MoveToWorkspace1AndFollow"
"alt+shift+2" = "MoveToWorkspace2AndFollow"
# ... etc
```

On macOS, these automatically use `opt+` (Option key) instead of `alt+`.

### Customizing Workspace Count

Currently, TUIOS supports exactly 9 workspaces. This is a design choice balancing:
- Single-digit keyboard shortcuts (1-9)
- Sufficient organization capability
- Memory and performance efficiency

<Tip>
If you need more separation, consider using multiple sessions (`tuios new project1`, `tuios new project2`) instead of more workspaces.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Windows Disappear After Workspace Switch

**Cause**: You moved a window to another workspace unintentionally.

**Solution**: Check all workspaces by cycling through with `Alt+1` through `Alt+9`. The window is still there.

### Tiling Broken After Workspace Switch

**Cause**: Each workspace has independent tiling state.

**Solution**: 
```bash
# Re-enable tiling on the current workspace
t  # Toggle tiling on

# Or via prefix
Ctrl+B Space
```

### Focus Lost When Switching to Empty Workspace

**Expected behavior**: When switching to a workspace with no windows, you're automatically put into Window Management Mode. Press `n` to create a new window.

### Workspace State Not Persisting

**Cause**: Running in local mode instead of daemon mode.

**Solution**: Use persistent sessions:
```bash
# Instead of just "tuios", use:
tuios new mysession  # State persists across detach/reattach
```

## Scripting Examples

### Create Multi-Workspace Layout

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup-workspaces.sh - Create a development environment

# Workspace 1: Editor
tuios run-command SwitchWorkspace 1
tuios run-command NewWindow "editor"
tuios send-keys --literal --raw "vim ." && tuios send-keys Enter

# Workspace 2: Terminal
tuios run-command SwitchWorkspace 2  
tuios run-command NewWindow "terminal"

# Workspace 3: Logs
tuios run-command SwitchWorkspace 3
tuios run-command NewWindow "logs"
tuios send-keys --literal --raw "tail -f app.log" && tuios send-keys Enter

# Return to workspace 1
tuios run-command SwitchWorkspace 1
```

### Monitor Workspace Usage

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# workspace-summary.sh - Show window distribution across workspaces

tuios session-info --json | jq -r '
  .workspace_windows | 
  to_entries | 
  map("Workspace \(.key + 1): \(.value) windows") | 
  .[]'
```

Output:
```
Workspace 1: 3 windows
Workspace 2: 2 windows
Workspace 3: 0 windows
...
```

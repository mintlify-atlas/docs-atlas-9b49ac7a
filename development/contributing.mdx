description: Guidelines for contributing to the TUIOS project
---

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TUIOS! This guide will help you get started with contributing code, documentation, and bug reports.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to TUIOS:

- **Report bugs** - Open issues for bugs you encounter
- **Suggest features** - Share ideas for new functionality
- **Submit pull requests** - Fix bugs or add features
- **Improve documentation** - Help make the docs clearer and more comprehensive
- **Share your experience** - Blog posts, tutorials, and demos help grow the community

## Code Contribution Workflow

### 1. Fork and Clone

Fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tuios.git
cd tuios
```

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a feature branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

Write your code following the project's coding conventions (see below).

### 4. Test Your Changes

Ensure all tests pass and add new tests if needed:

```bash
go test ./...
```

See the [Testing Guide](/development/testing) for more details.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit messages (see below):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add window split functionality"
```

### 6. Push and Create a Pull Request

Push your branch and create a pull request on GitHub:

```bash
git push origin feat/my-new-feature
```

## Go Coding Conventions

TUIOS follows standard Go coding practices:

### Code Style

- **Run `go fmt`** - Always format your code before committing:
  ```bash
  go fmt ./...
  ```

- **Follow Effective Go** - Read the [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) guide

- **Use meaningful names** - Avoid single-letter variables except for loop indices

- **Add package comments** - Every package should have a doc comment explaining its purpose

- **Document exports** - All exported types, functions, and constants need godoc-style comments

### Error Handling

Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf`:

```go
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to create window: %w", err)
}
```

Log warnings for non-fatal issues:

```go
log.Printf("Warning: config file not found, using defaults")
```

Return early on errors to reduce nesting.

### Testing Conventions

- Use **table-driven tests** for multiple test cases
- Name test files with `_test.go` suffix
- Use `t.Run()` for subtests
- Add benchmarks with `Benchmark*` prefix

Example table-driven test:

```go
func TestParser(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected string
    }{
        {"basic", "hello", "hello"},
        {"quoted", "\"world\"", "world"},
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result := Parse(tt.input)
            if result != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", result, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

## Commit Message Format

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build scripts)
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, naming)

### Examples

```bash
feat: add configurable dockbar position
fix: prevent panic when closing last window on Linux
docs: update keybindings reference for Ctrl+B prefix
refactor: extract window layout logic into separate package
test: add integration tests for tape scripting
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

### Writing Good Commit Messages

- Use imperative mood: "add feature" not "added feature"
- Keep the subject line under 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Don't end the subject line with a period
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Explain **why** not **what** in the body

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update documentation** - Add or update relevant docs
2. **Add tests** - Include tests for new functionality
3. **Run tests** - Ensure `go test ./...` passes
4. **Check formatting** - Run `go fmt ./...`
5. **Update CHANGELOG** - Add entry if applicable

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Write a clear title** - Use conventional commit format
- **Describe your changes** - Explain what and why in the PR description
- **Reference issues** - Link related issues ("Fixes #123")
- **Keep PRs focused** - One feature or fix per PR
- **Respond to feedback** - Address review comments promptly
- **Update your branch** - Rebase on main if needed

### PR Template

```markdown
## Description
Brief description of the changes

## Motivation
Why are these changes needed?

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass (`go test ./...`)
- [ ] Code formatted (`go fmt ./...`)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Commits follow conventional commit format
```

## Code Review Process

All pull requests require review before merging:

1. **Automated checks** - CI runs tests and linters
2. **Code review** - Maintainers review your code
3. **Feedback** - Address any requested changes
4. **Approval** - Once approved, your PR will be merged

### Review Timeline

Maintainers aim to review PRs within a few days. For urgent fixes, mention this in the PR.

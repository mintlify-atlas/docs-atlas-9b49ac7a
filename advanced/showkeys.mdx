title: Showkeys Overlay
description: Display pressed keys on screen for presentations, screencasts, and live coding
---

The showkeys overlay displays your keyboard input on screen in real-time, making TUIOS ideal for presentations, screencasts, and live coding demos. When enabled, every key you press appears in a clean, unobtrusive overlay at the bottom of the screen.

## Overview

Showkeys solves a common problem in terminal screencasts: viewers can't see what keys you're pressing. Without visual feedback, audiences miss important keyboard shortcuts and get confused about how you're navigating.

The showkeys overlay captures and displays:

- Individual keystrokes
- Modifier combinations (Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Cmd)
- Action names (when a key triggers a TUIOS action)
- Key repeat counts
- Timing information

## Enabling Showkeys

### At Startup

Enable showkeys when launching TUIOS:

```bash
tuios --show-keys
```

For session-based workflows:

```bash
tuios new demo --show-keys
tuios attach demo
```

For SSH server mode:

```bash
tuios ssh --show-keys --host 0.0.0.0 --port 2222
```

### Toggle During Runtime

While TUIOS is running, toggle showkeys:

<Note>
Throughout this guide, `Ctrl+B` refers to the default leader key. This is configurable via the `leader_key` option in your config file.
</Note>

```
Ctrl+B D k               # Via debug prefix menu
```

Showkeys state persists for the current session but resets on restart unless you use `--show-keys` flag.

### In Web Terminal

Pass the flag to tuios-web:

```bash
tuios-web --show-keys --port 7681
```

Showkeys works identically in browser-based terminals.

## What Gets Displayed

### Basic Keys

Single keystrokes appear with their character:

```
a    j    x    1    Space    Enter    Esc
```

### Modifier Combinations

Modifier keys combine with the base key:

```
Ctrl+C        Shift+Tab        Alt+1        Ctrl+Shift+T
```

### Action Names

When a key triggers a TUIOS action, the action name appears:

```
n → new_window
t → toggle_tiling
Alt+2 → switch_workspace_2
Ctrl+B c → prefix_new_window
```

This helps viewers understand not just what key was pressed, but what it did.

### Key Repeats

Holding a key shows a repeat count:

```
j ×3          # Pressed 'j' three times rapidly
Down ×5       # Held down arrow
```

### Special Keys

Common special keys display with readable names:

```
Tab    Enter    Esc    Backspace    Delete
Up     Down     Left   Right        Home    End
F1     F2       ...    F12
PgUp   PgDn     Insert
```

## Display Format

### Overlay Position

The showkeys overlay appears at the **bottom-center** of the screen, above the status bar but below any windows.

### Ring Buffer

TUIOS shows the last **5 keystrokes** by default. Older keys slide out as new ones arrive:

```
[Ctrl+B] [c] [i] [l] [s]
```

The history limit prevents clutter while providing enough context.

### Visual Styling

Keys appear in rounded boxes with theming that matches your current TUIOS theme:

```
┌────────┐ ┌───┐ ┌───────────────┐
│ Ctrl+B │ │ c │ │ new_window    │
└────────┘ └───┘ └───────────────┘
```

### Transparency

The overlay uses semi-transparent backgrounds to avoid completely obscuring terminal content underneath.

## Use Cases

### Screencasting and Tutorials

Perfect for creating terminal tutorials where viewers need to see exactly what you're typing:

```bash
# Record screencast with showkeys
tuios --show-keys
# Start recording with your screen capture tool
# Perform your demo
```

Viewers see both the terminal output and your keystrokes, making it easy to follow along.

### Live Presentations

During conference talks or live coding sessions, showkeys lets audience members see your shortcuts:

```bash
# Before presentation
tuios new presentation --show-keys --theme nord
```

Attendees can take notes on the specific keys you use without constantly asking "what did you just press?"

### Teaching and Onboarding

When teaching new developers how to use TUIOS or terminal workflows:

```bash
tuios --show-keys --theme github
```

Students see exactly how to navigate, create windows, and execute commands.

### Recording Demos for Documentation

Capture animated demos for README files or documentation:

```bash
# Record with showkeys
tuios --show-keys
asciinema rec demo.cast
# Perform demo
exit
```

The resulting recording includes visible keystrokes, making it self-documenting.

### Debugging Keybinding Issues

When troubleshooting keybinding conflicts or testing custom configurations:

```bash
tuios --show-keys --debug
```

Watch the overlay to confirm TUIOS receives the correct key events and resolves them to the expected actions.

## Examples

### Example 1: Recording a Tutorial

```bash
# Start TUIOS with showkeys and a clean theme
tuios --show-keys --theme github

# Start recording with asciinema
asciinema rec tuios-demo.cast

# Perform demo:
# - Create windows with 'n'
# - Enable tiling with 't'
# - Navigate with Tab
# - Switch workspaces with Alt+1, Alt+2

# Stop recording
exit
```

**Result:** A recording where viewers see every keystroke and its corresponding action.

### Example 2: Live Presentation Setup

```bash
# Before audience arrives
tuios new workshop --show-keys --theme nord

# Maximize terminal window
# Adjust font size for visibility

# Detach and prepare
Ctrl+B d

# When ready to present
tuios attach workshop
```

Showkeys state persists in the session.

### Example 3: Teaching Workflow

```bash
# Instructor terminal
tuios --show-keys --theme dracula

# Share screen and demonstrate:
n                    # Students see "n → new_window"
i                    # Students see "i → enter_terminal_mode"
Type commands        # Students see keystrokes
Ctrl+B d             # Students see "Ctrl+B d → enter_window_mode"
t                    # Students see "t → toggle_tiling"
```

Students can follow along precisely.

### Example 4: Debugging Custom Keybindings

```bash
# Test custom keybindings with showkeys
tuios --show-keys

# Edit config to add custom binding
Ctrl+B c e           # (hypothetical custom binding)

# Press the custom key
# Watch showkeys to confirm:
# - Key is received correctly
# - Action name appears (or doesn't if misconfigured)
```

Helps diagnose keybinding conflicts or typos in config.

## Configuration

### History Size

The default ring buffer shows **5 keys**. This is currently hardcoded in the OS struct (`KeyHistoryMaxSize`).

<Info>
Future versions may expose this as a configuration option.
</Info>

### Disable Specific Keys

There's no filter to hide specific keys (e.g., passwords). If you're typing sensitive information, toggle showkeys off temporarily:

```
Ctrl+B D k               # Toggle off
# Type sensitive data
Ctrl+B D k               # Toggle back on
```

### Theme Integration

Showkeys automatically adapts to your current theme. The overlay colors derive from your terminal's ANSI palette:

```bash
tuios --theme dracula --show-keys      # Purple/pink theme
tuios --theme nord --show-keys         # Blue/arctic theme
```

No additional configuration needed.

## Technical Details

### Key Capture

Showkeys hooks into the input handling pipeline at `internal/input/keyboard.go`. Every key event passes through the showkeys recorder before normal processing.

### Data Structure

Recent keys are stored in a ring buffer:

```go
type KeyEvent struct {
    Key       string       // "a", "Ctrl+C", "Enter"
    Modifiers []string     // ["Ctrl", "Shift"]
    Timestamp time.Time    // When pressed
    Count     int          // Repeat count
    Action    string       // "new_window", "toggle_tiling"
}
```

### Performance Impact

Showkeys has minimal overhead:

- **Memory**: ~1KB for key history
- **CPU**: < 0.1% additional processing per keystroke
- **Rendering**: No performance impact (overlay is lightweight)

## Troubleshooting

### Overlay Not Appearing

**Check if enabled:**
```bash
# Status bar should show indicator when active
```

**Toggle it:**
```
Ctrl+B D k
```

**Verify at startup:**
```bash
tuios --show-keys
```

### Keys Not Showing

**Modifier key issues:**  
Some terminals don't send all modifier combinations. For example, `Ctrl+Shift+letter` might arrive as just `Ctrl+letter`.

**Solution:** Use a terminal with proper keyboard protocol support (kitty, wezterm, alacritty).

**Key captured but no action name:**  
Not all keys map to TUIOS actions. Only keybindings configured in your config file show action names.

### Overlay Position Issues

**Terminal size too small:**  
Showkeys needs at least 3 rows of vertical space. On very small terminals (< 20 rows), the overlay might be cut off.

**Solution:** Resize your terminal to at least 24 rows.

**Overlapping with content:**  
The overlay intentionally uses transparency. If it's hard to read over busy terminal output, toggle it off temporarily or use a theme with higher contrast.

### Performance Issues

If you experience slowdown with showkeys enabled:

**Check debug logging:**
```bash
tuios --show-keys --debug
```

Excessive logging can slow things down. Disable debug mode if not needed.

**Reduce active windows:**  
With 10+ windows, rendering overhead increases. Showkeys is rarely the issue, but combined overhead can accumulate.

## What is TUIOS?

TUIOS (Terminal UI Operating System) is a terminal-based window manager that provides a modern, efficient interface for managing multiple terminal sessions. Built with Go using the Charm stack (Bubble Tea v2 and Lipgloss v2), TUIOS offers a vim-like modal interface with comprehensive keyboard shortcuts, workspace support, and mouse interaction.

Think of it as tmux meets a modern window manager - with the power of vim's modal editing, the organization of workspaces, and the polish of a desktop environment, all in your terminal.

## Why TUIOS?

### Powerful Window Management

Unlike traditional terminal multiplexers, TUIOS provides true window management:
- Drag, resize, and snap windows with mouse or keyboard
- Automatic tiling with BSP algorithm or manual floating mode
- Visual feedback with borders, shadows, and smooth animations
- Edge-based snapping (drag to screen edges for instant layouts)

### Workspace Organization

Manage complex workflows with 9 independent workspaces:
- One workspace for development, another for monitoring, another for documentation
- Windows stay organized and out of sight until needed
- Move windows between workspaces or switch workspace while staying in terminal mode

### Vim-Powered Navigation

If you love vim, you'll feel at home:
- Modal interface prevents keybinding conflicts
- Copy mode with h/j/k/l navigation, search (/ and ?), and text selection
- Familiar prefix key system (Ctrl+B like tmux, fully customizable)
- 100+ configurable keybindings

### Automation-First Design

Tape scripting brings automation to terminal workflows:
```tape
# Create a development environment
NewWindow
Type "cd ~/project && vim"
Enter
Ctrl+B
Type "n"
Sleep 500ms
Type "npm run dev"
Enter
```

Record sessions with Ctrl+B T r, then replay them or run headless in CI.

### Modern Performance

Built with performance in mind:
- Smart style caching (40-60% allocation reduction)
- Viewport culling for off-screen windows
- Adaptive refresh rates (60Hz focused, 30Hz background)
- Memory pooling for strings, buffers, and styles
- Works smoothly with dozens of windows

## Architecture

TUIOS is built on battle-tested technologies:

- **Bubble Tea v2** - Event-driven TUI framework with Model-View-Update pattern
- **Lipgloss v2** - Terminal styling and layout engine
- **go-pty** - Cross-platform PTY interface for true terminal emulation
- **Wish v2** - SSH server framework for remote access
- **Vendored VT emulator** - Complete ANSI/VT100 terminal emulation

The architecture follows clean separation:
- Window Manager (internal/app/os.go) - Central state and workspace orchestration  
- Terminal Emulation (internal/vt/) - ANSI parser with scrollback
- Rendering Engine (internal/app/render.go) - Layer composition with viewport culling
- Input System (internal/input/) - Modal routing and configurable keybindings

## Use Cases

<Note>
TUIOS excels at managing complex terminal workflows where you need multiple sessions organized and accessible.
</Note>

**Development Workflows**
- Editor in one window, test runner in another, logs in a third
- Separate workspaces for different projects
- Tape scripts to set up your entire dev environment

**System Administration**  
- Monitor multiple servers in different windows
- Keep production and staging in separate workspaces
- SSH server mode for remote administration

**DevOps & CI/CD**
- Tape scripts for deployment automation
- Headless execution for automated testing
- Record workflows and share them as documentation

**Terminal Enthusiasts**
- Full mouse support when you want it, pure keyboard when you don't
- Showkeys overlay for presentations and screencasts
- Customizable themes and border styles

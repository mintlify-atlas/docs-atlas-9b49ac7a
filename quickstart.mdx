## Launch TUIOS

Start TUIOS from your terminal:

```bash
tuios
```

You'll see the TUIOS interface with:
- A single terminal window (Window 1) running your default shell
- A dockbar at the bottom showing all windows
- A clock in the top-right corner
- Status indicators for workspace and mode

<Note>
TUIOS starts in **Window Management Mode** by default. This mode lets you create, navigate, and organize windows. Press `i` or `Enter` to switch to **Terminal Mode** where your input goes directly to the focused terminal.
</Note>

## Understanding Modes

TUIOS has two primary modes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Window Management Mode" icon="layer-group">
    Navigate and manage windows, workspaces, and layouts. Most keybindings work without conflicts.
    
    **Indicators:** Border around focused window, mode shown in status bar
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Terminal Mode" icon="terminal">
    Input goes directly to the focused terminal. Use Ctrl+B prefix for TUIOS commands.
    
    **Indicators:** Cursor visible in terminal, prompt active
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Switching modes:**
- Press `i` or `Enter` to enter Terminal Mode (from Window Management Mode)
- Press `Ctrl+B` then `d`, or `Esc` to return to Window Management Mode

## Essential Keybindings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your First Window">
    
Let's create a second window to see TUIOS in action.

**In Window Management Mode:**
```
Press: n
```

**From any mode (using prefix):**  
```
Press: Ctrl+B, then c
```

You should now see two windows. The dockbar at the bottom shows both "Window 1" and "Window 2".

<Tip>
The `Ctrl+B` prefix system (like tmux) works from any mode. Press `Ctrl+B`, release, then press the command key.
</Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Switch Between Windows">
    
Navigate between your windows:

**Keyboard navigation:**
```
Tab          - Focus next window
Shift+Tab    - Focus previous window  
1, 2, 3...   - Jump to window by number (in Window Management Mode)
```

**Mouse navigation:**
```
Click any window to focus it
```

The focused window will have a highlighted border.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Terminal Mode">
    
To actually use a terminal, enter Terminal Mode:

```
Press: i (or Enter)
```

Now type some commands:

```bash
# You're now in Terminal Mode - your input goes to the shell
ls -la
echo "Hello from TUIOS!"
top
```

**Notice:** You can still use `Ctrl+B` prefix commands:

```
Ctrl+B, c    - Create new window (without leaving Terminal Mode)
Ctrl+B, ?    - Show help overlay
Ctrl+B, d    - Return to Window Management Mode
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Try Window Layouts">
    
Return to Window Management Mode (`Ctrl+B` then `d`) and try snapping windows:

```
h    - Snap focused window to left half
l    - Snap focused window to right half  
f    - Fullscreen focused window
u    - Unsnap/restore window
```

Or enable automatic tiling:

```
t    - Toggle BSP tiling mode
```

With tiling enabled, create a few more windows (press `n` repeatedly). Watch how TUIOS automatically arranges them in a balanced layout.

**Tiling mode keybindings:**
```
Shift+H      - Swap with window to the left
Shift+L      - Swap with window to the right
<            - Decrease master window width  
>            - Increase master window width
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Workspaces">
    
Organize windows across 9 independent workspaces:

```
Alt+1        - Switch to workspace 1
Alt+2        - Switch to workspace 2
...          
Alt+9        - Switch to workspace 9
```

**On macOS:** Use `Option+1` through `Option+9`

**Move windows between workspaces:**
```
Alt+Shift+2  - Move focused window to workspace 2 (and follow)
```

Try this workflow:
1. Press `Alt+1` to ensure you're on workspace 1
2. Press `Alt+2` to switch to workspace 2 (empty)
3. Press `n` to create a window on workspace 2
4. Press `Alt+1` to go back to workspace 1  
5. Notice workspace 2's windows are hidden until you switch back

  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore Copy Mode">
    
Copy mode lets you navigate scrollback and copy text with vim keybindings:

```
Ctrl+B, [    - Enter copy mode
```

**In copy mode:**
```
j/k          - Move cursor down/up (vim-style)
h/l          - Move cursor left/right
w/b          - Jump forward/backward by word
/            - Search forward  
?            - Search backward
v            - Start visual selection
y            - Yank (copy) selected text
Esc or q     - Exit copy mode
```

**Example:** Scroll back through your terminal history:

1. Run some commands to generate output: `ls -la && pwd && date`
2. Press `Ctrl+B` then `[` to enter copy mode
3. Press `k` several times to scroll up
4. Press `/` and type a search term, then Enter
5. Press `v` to start selecting, move cursor, press `y` to copy
6. Press `Esc` to exit copy mode

<Note>
TUIOS keeps 10,000 lines of scrollback per terminal by default. You can configure this with the `--scrollback-lines` flag or in the config file.
</Note>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Workflows

### Development Environment Setup

Create a typical development layout:

```
1. Launch TUIOS: tuios
2. Press 'n' three times to create 4 windows total  
3. Press 't' to enable tiling
4. Press 'i' to enter Terminal Mode in window 1
5. Type: vim src/main.go
6. Press Ctrl+B, then Tab to go to window 2
7. Type: go run ./cmd/app
8. Press Ctrl+B, then Tab to go to window 3  
9. Type: go test ./...
10. Press Ctrl+B, then Tab to go to window 4
11. Type: git status
```

Now you have: editor, app runner, test watcher, and git - all visible at once.

### Monitor Multiple Servers

```
1. Launch TUIOS
2. Switch to workspace 1: Alt+1  
3. Create windows for production: n, n, n (3 servers)
4. In each window, SSH to a production server
5. Switch to workspace 2: Alt+2
6. Create windows for staging: n, n, n  
7. In each window, SSH to a staging server
```

Now you can monitor production (workspace 1) and staging (workspace 2) separately.

### Session Persistence (Daemon Mode)

Keep your TUIOS sessions running even after detaching:

```bash
# Create a new persistent session
tuios new my-project

# Do some work...
# Press Ctrl+B then Ctrl+D to detach

# Later, reattach to your session  
tuios attach my-project

# List all sessions
tuios ls

# Kill a session
tuios kill-session my-project
```

All your windows, workspaces, and terminal content are preserved!

## Universal Keybindings (Work from Any Mode)

These use the `Ctrl+B` prefix and work whether you're in Window Management or Terminal Mode:

```
Ctrl+B, c    - Create new window
Ctrl+B, ?    - Toggle help overlay  
Ctrl+B, [    - Enter copy mode (vim-style scrollback)
Ctrl+B, d    - Return to Window Management Mode (or detach in daemon mode)
Ctrl+B, q    - Quit TUIOS
Ctrl+B, 1-9  - Switch to workspace 1-9 (alternative to Alt+1-9)
```

**Window management submenu (Ctrl+B, t):**
```
Ctrl+B, t, n - Create new window  
Ctrl+B, t, x - Close window
Ctrl+B, t, r - Rename window
Ctrl+B, t, t - Toggle tiling
```

**Tape recording submenu (Ctrl+B, T):**
```  
Ctrl+B, T, r - Start recording tape
Ctrl+B, T, s - Stop recording tape
```

tuios keybinds list

# List only custom keybindings
tuios keybinds list-custom
```

The config file lets you:
- Customize all keybindings (100+ configurable)
- Change the leader key (default: Ctrl+B)
- Set default theme, border style, dockbar position
- Configure scrollback buffer size
- Customize window title position

## Run with Options

TUIOS supports many command-line flags:

```bash  
# Run with a specific theme
tuios --theme dracula

# List all available themes
tuios --list-themes

# Run in ASCII-only mode (no Nerd Font icons)  
tuios --ascii-only

# Enable debug logging
tuios --debug

# Hide the dockbar
tuios --dockbar-position hidden  

# Disable animations
tuios --no-animations

# Show keypresses (for presentations)
tuios --show-keys
```

## Advanced Features

### SSH Server Mode

Run TUIOS as an SSH server for remote access:

```bash
# Start SSH server on default port (2222)  
tuios ssh

# Custom port and host
tuios ssh --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8022

# Connect from another machine
ssh -p 2222 user@hostname
```

### Web Terminal Mode

Access TUIOS from a web browser (requires `tuios-web` binary):

```bash  
# Start web terminal server
tuios-web

# Custom port with theme

```bash
# Record a session (press Ctrl+B T r while in TUIOS)
# Perform actions...
# Stop recording (press Ctrl+B T s)  

# List recordings
tuios tape list

# Play back interactively (with visible TUI)
tuios tape play my-recording.tape

# Run headless (background automation)  
tuios tape run script.tape

# Validate tape syntax
tuios tape validate script.tape
```

Example tape file:
```tape
# automation.tape
NewWindow  
Sleep 500ms
Type "echo 'Setting up environment...'"
Enter
Sleep 1s
Ctrl+B
Type "n"
Sleep 500ms  
Type "npm run dev"
Enter
```

## Tips for Productivity

<Tip>
**Workspace Strategy:** Organize by project or context. For example:
- Workspace 1: Frontend development  
- Workspace 2: Backend development
- Workspace 3: Database and monitoring
- Workspace 4: Documentation and notes
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Window Naming:** Rename windows (press `r` in Window Management Mode) to identify them easily. The dockbar shows window names.
</Tip>

<Tip>  
**Learn Incrementally:** Start with basic window creation and navigation. Add tiling mode when comfortable. Learn copy mode and tape scripting as needed. Don't try to memorize all keybindings at once.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Customize Early:** Run `tuios config edit` and customize the leader key or commonly-used keybindings to match your muscle memory from vim/tmux/i3.
</Tip>

You're now ready to use TUIOS productively. Happy terminal multiplexing!
